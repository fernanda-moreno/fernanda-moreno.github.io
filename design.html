    <h2>Dr. Bill Interview Prep App Prototype (Spring 2020)</h2>
    <h3>Skills used: Figma, Interaction Design</h3>
    <p> In my Interaction Design class, I worked with a team to design a voice tech mobile application aimed at helping
      students prepare for job interviews.
      The face of our interview prep voice tech app is Dr. Bill, a lively animoji character that aims to represent a
      real interviewer.
      On the app, users can upload their resume, start a mock interview at any time, and receive feedback on how well
      they answered each question and how they can improve.
      During the mock interviews, Dr. Bill asks users general behavioral questions as well as technical questions that
      are tailored to the user's resume.
      As a <b>UX and interaction designer</b> in this project, I took part in designing the interview and feedback
      logistics, conducting heuristic evaluations, and designing the app screens for the feedback portion of the
      interview experience.
      When the semester ended, I continued to redesign the prototype's introductory and interview screens in an attempt
      to further develop my design skills.
      Check out our prototype <a

    <h2>Excel Program Tracker (Fall 2019 & Spring 2020)</h2>
    <h3>Skills used: Adobe XD, Paper Prototyping, User Experience Research & Design</h3>
    <p> For our Junior Design project, my team and I have designed and developed
      a web application system for the <a href="https://www.scheller.gatech.edu/centers-initiatives/excel/index.html"
        target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="nav-link" style="color:grey;">Excel Program at Georgia Tech</a>
      to help faculty and administrators track the progress of students in the program. Our team spent the Fall 2019
      semester meeting with the Career Development Coordinator of the Excel Program,
      conducting user research, writing reports on our observations, and designing a potential tracking system. As a
      user experience designer for our prototype, my role was to design the layout and interactions on the
      page that displays the list of all users as well as the page for individual instructors.
      In the Spring 2020 semester, my team and I worked on implementing the Excel Program Student Progress Tracker with
      ReactJS.

    <h2>NASA HUNCH Calendar Section (Summer 2019)</h2>
    <h3>Skills used: WordPress, HTML, CSS, Adobe XD</h3>
    <p> As a software development and design intern at NASA Ames Research Center, one of my tasks was to design a
      calendar
      section for the <a href="https://www.nasahunch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="nav-link"
        style="color:grey;">NASA HUNCH</a> website in order to increase
      student awareness of program events throughout the nation.
      I chose to include both a grid and list view of the calendar so that people are able to see how eventful the
      current month is in the grid view, and details of the upcoming events in the list view.
      The calendar was implemented through a WordPress plug-in and customized with CSS so that the font and colors
      matched the rest of the website.
      As events are added to the NASA HUNCH Google Calendar, the calendar and upcoming events section will update
      automatically.
    </p>

    <h2>Travel Troopers App & Map Prototype (Summer 2018)</h2>
    <h3>Skills used: Adobe XD, physical model, Wizard of Oz Prototyping</h3>
    <p> In 2018, I studied abroad on Georgia Tech's Barcelona Summer Program and took a class on User Interface Design.
      For our final project, my team and I created a prototype of a mobile app and augmented reality
      map interface that helped groups traveling abroad find the best local restaurants as recommended by their friends.
      In addition to
      recommendations, our app and map interfaces included the ability to provide directions to these locations,
      facilitate
      communication, and share photos among groups of friends.</p>

    <h2>Futuristic Pet Bowl (Summer 2018)</h2>
    <h3>Skills used: Sketching, paper interface</h3>
    <p> In my UI Design class, I was assigned an open-ended individual project where I had to design, layout, and mockup
      a Family Messaging System that a busy family could use to communicate with each other across time and space. My
      idea was to
      create something that would allow a family to communicate in terms of when their pet was last fed or if it had
      already been
      fed by another family member. The invention I designed was a futuristic pet bowl that recorded the time that food
      was last placed
      into the pet's bowl so members of the family would know if their pet needed their food to be served. Below you
      will find the design sketches for this project.</p>

    $('.myImg').click(function () {

      var newSrc = this.src;
      modalImg.attr('src', newSrc);
      captionText.innerHTML = this.alt;
