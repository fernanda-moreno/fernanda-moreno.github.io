      <h2>Travel Troopers App & Map Prototype</h2>
      <p>   While studying abroad in Georgia Tech's Barcelona Summer Program (2018), I took a class on User Interface Design.
        For our group project throughout the entire course, my team and I created a prototype of an app and augmented reality
        map interface that helped groups traveling abroad find the best local restaurants as recommended by their friends. In addition to
        recommendations, our app and map interfaces included the ability to provide directions to these locations and facilitate
        communication among groups of friends.</p>

    <div id="PetBowl">
        <h2>Futuristic Pet Bowl</h2>
        <p>   In the same UI class, I was assigned an open-ended individual project where I had to design, layout, and mockup
        a Family Messaging System that a busy family could use to communicate with each other across time and space. My idea was to
        create something that would allow a family to communicate in terms of when their pet was last fed or if it had already been
        fed by another family member. The invention I designed was a futuristic pet bowl that recorded the time that food was last placed
        into the pet's bowl so members of the family would know if their pet needed their food to be served. Below you will find the report
        and design sketches for this project.</p>
