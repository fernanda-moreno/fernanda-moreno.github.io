    <h2>CS Junior Design: Excel Program Tracker</h2>
    <h3>Skills used: Adobe XD, Paper Prototyping, User Experience Research & Design</h3>
    <p>   For our Junior Design project, my team and I have chosen to design and develop
      a web application system for the <a href="https://www.scheller.gatech.edu/centers-initiatives/excel/index.html" target="_blank" class="nav-link" style = "color:grey;">Excel Program at Georgia Tech</a>
      to help faculty and administrators track the progress of students in the program. Our team spent the entire Fall 2019 semester meeting with the Career Development Coordinator of the Excel Program,
      conducting user research, writing reports on our observations, and designing a potential tracking system that we will begin implementing in the Spring 2020 semester.
      Check out our prototype <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/8b07741c-abe1-4f0f-526e-f6cb7ce978ab-fd36/" target="_blank" class="nav-link" style = "color:grey;">here</a>,
      and the video I put together which describes the project in detail <a href="https://youtu.be/2SMXWJEoG3M" target="_blank" class="nav-link" style = "color:grey;">here</a>.

    <h2>NASA HUNCH Calendar Section</h2>
    <h3>Skills used: WordPress, HTML, CSS, Adobe XD</h3>
    <p>   As a software development and design intern at NASA Ames Research Center, I was given the task to design a calendar
      section for the <a href="https://www.nasahunch.com/" target="_blank" class="nav-link" style = "color:grey;">NASA HUNCH</a> website in order to increase
      student awareness of program events throughout the nation.
      The calendar was implemented through a WordPress plug-in and customized with CSS so that the font and colors matched the rest of the website.
      As events are added to the NASA HUNCH Google Calendar, the calendar and upcoming events section will update automatically.
      The image below captures how the calendar appears on the existing <b>Get Involved</b> page. Check it out on the live site <a href="https://www.nasahunch.com/get-involved" target="_blank" class="nav-link" style = "color:grey;">here</a>.

      <h2>Alcohol Education VR Prototype</h2>
      <h3>Skills used: User Research, Product Design, Video making & editing</h3>
      <p>   For my Educational Technology class, I worked with a team to design an interactive film prototype for an alcohol education
      virtual reality simulation. In our product, users are taken through a personalized experience of alcohol usage on a college campus
      in an effort to raise awareness of the dangers of alcohol misuse and tackle misconceptions.
      We created a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeTnjrg08D21L1q4eaK2aLAErM0_TlXlRASUylifrSP5j3XaQ/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank" class="nav-link" style = "color:grey;">personalization quiz</a> that determines users' preferred social setting and the effects that alochol would have on them
      throughout the simulation. Throughout the experience, users would make decisions that change the course of the simulation. The prototype below consists of a series
      of videos that follow the experience of a pseudo college freshman named Alex. </p>

      <h2>Organizational Branding Project</h2>
      <h3>Skills used: Adobe - Illustrator, Dimension</h3>
      <p>   For this project, I designed a logo and brand identity system for a coffee shop dedicated
      to people who are involved in or aspire to work in the field of technology. I named the brand <b>Code & Coffee Co.</b>
      and envisioned it as a productive space for students in tech as well as professional software engineers and developers.
   The simplistic and iconic logo for <b>Code & Coffee Co.</b> illustrates a cup filled with hot coffee marked by the HTML break symbol to demonstrate
   a coffee break. The image represents the main product sold at the company and the HTML tag signifies that coding and technology
 are incorporated into the theme of this coffee shop.</p>

        <h2>Emoji Collage</h2>
        <h3>Skills used: Adobe Photoshop</h3>
        <p>    For my Principles of Visual Design class, I designed a set of emojis that represent the feelings of a community of my choice.
          I chose the Computational Media (CM) community because I felt close to this group and I knew some classmates and members from CM Ambassadors who I could photograph for this project. Each image represents a different emotion
          or trait within the CM community.</p>

      <h2>Travel Troopers App & Map Prototype</h2>
      <h3>Skills used: Adobe XD, physical model, Wizard of Oz Prototyping</h3>
      <p>   While studying abroad in Georgia Tech's Barcelona Summer Program (2018), I took a class on User Interface Design.
        For our group project throughout the entire course, my team and I created a prototype of an app and augmented reality
        map interface that helped groups traveling abroad find the best local restaurants as recommended by their friends. In addition to
        recommendations, our app and map interfaces included the ability to provide directions to these locations and facilitate
        communication among groups of friends.</p>

        <h2>Futuristic Pet Bowl</h2>
        <h3>Skills used: Sketching, paper interface</h3>
        <p>   In my UI Design class, I was assigned an open-ended individual project where I had to design, layout, and mockup
        a Family Messaging System that a busy family could use to communicate with each other across time and space. My idea was to
        create something that would allow a family to communicate in terms of when their pet was last fed or if it had already been
        fed by another family member. The invention I designed was a futuristic pet bowl that recorded the time that food was last placed
        into the pet's bowl so members of the family would know if their pet needed their food to be served. Below you will find the design sketches for this project.</p>
